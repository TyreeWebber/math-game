Classes

1. Player 
  - Initialized with (3) lives. 
  - Require a method to remove lost lives if lives > 0.
  - When lives = 0, player loses.
  
# defining player class
class Player 
  attr_accessor :name, :lives
end

# method to remove lost lives and end game if player hits 0 lives.
=begin
tbh at this point I have 0 clue how to implement this with ruby... BUT I WILL LEARN!!!
=end

2. Question
   - Have a single method "question"
   - Need to generate 2 random numbers num 1 = rand(1...x(idk what to go up to yet))
   - Asks a question "what is #{num1} plus #{num2}" / "what is #{num1} - #{num2}"
   - Define an answer (answer = num1 + num2 / answer = num1-num2)
   - User answers using $stdin.gets.chomp.to_i
   - Evaluates answer and outputs appropriate answer (answer === user-input => "Correct!" / answer !== user-input => "Incorrect YOU'VE LOST A LIFE!")

   =begin
   at this point I also have no clue how to implement this with ruby.
   =end

3. Game
   - Contains the loop.
   - Needs to create a new game with 2 players.
   - Game needs to initialize with parameter which takes in an array of 2 players and sets them and current player (who's turn it is).
  
   ??
   @player1 = Player.new(players[0])
   @player2 = Player.new(players[1])
   user a attr_accessor somewhere?
   - Needs a method to start a game.
      - Needs a method that asks questions to current player, then changes current player to other player afterwards.
      - continue to loop if both player lives > 0, if one player's lives hits 0 stop loop and that player loses.
